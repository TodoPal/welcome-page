# Welcome page
This is the welcome page of the TodoPal application.

It's a microfrontend application, so it is not meant to be used alone.

## Setup
For local development follow these steps:

Install the dependencies, then generete the CSS file with the following command in the project directory:
```
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css
```

After the CSS file is generated you can start the project with `npm start`.
